        "neighborhood_overview": "Indische Buurt (\"Indies Neighborhood\") is a neighbourhood in the eastern portion of the city of Amsterdam, in the Dutch province of Noord-Holland. The name dates from the early 20th century and is derived from the fact that the neighbourhood's streets are named after islands and other geographical concepts in the former Dutch colony of the Dutch East Indies. The first street was named in 1902. In 2003, there were around 23,357 inhabitants. The neighbourhood is bounded on the west by the railroad Amsterdam - Hilversum (with the Muiderpoort Station), on the east side by Flevopark, on the north side by Zeeburgerdijk and on the south side by the Ringvaart Watergraafsmeer. Indische Buurt is the oldest part of the Zeeburg district and is very ethnically diverse, and a high percentage of the population is of immigrant origin (for Zeeburg this is already high at 55%, but higher in the Indische Buurt) and there are an estimated 100 languages spoken.",

We can tip you off about local hangouts that you have to live here to know about and all the highlights that you really ought to see whilst you're here. This is the best area of the city to live in, that's why we picked it. Everything we need is right on our doorstep, we hardly ever have to leave our 'hood. You'll love it here too!",

        "description": "At Bed&Bike you can use the available bikes whenever you like, or use the kitchen to cook your own meals, and feel like a local! Ideal for travellers who want to live in a peaceful area, live like a local, meet other travellers but be in 10 mins in the centre by bike. The room is private - Bathroom, kitchen and rest of the house are SHARED with me (when I am home) and the other guests who rent the other room (max 2). If you are 4 people you don't need to share anything if you book both rooms.<br /><br /><b>The space</b><br />Do you want to avoid the tourist traps, feel like a local and uncover the hidden gems of Amsterdam while cruising around with your bike?<br /><br />Are you looking for a relaxed stay far from the noise of the city but still want to be 10 mins by bike from the centre?<br /><br />You are on the right place then! Welcome to Bed&Bike, a safe haven filled with love and good energy. I (Stephi) would be more than happy to welcome you & give you plenty of tips on where to ",
        "neighborhood_overview": "I love the west area of Amsterdam because it's quiet, handsome yet full with bustling shopping streets and only a few minutes from the centre. Here, you'll find the Vondelpark and the Rembrandt Park, great shops and the best restaurants in town, street markets as well as elegant mansions, cultural meeting points and excellent terraces.",

I also love travelling and I always go to places where I know someone who can show me around and help me feel like a local, not just a tourist!\r\r\nMany years ago I started to rent out my home to other travellers because I wanted to share my love and knowledge for Amsterdam and show what a great place it can be just with a bike and tips from a local. There is so much to see in Amsterdam. I believe you deserve to see what's really worth it and not just the touristic areas. I truly hope you can enjoy Amsterdam as much as I do.\r\r\nI'll do my best to make you feel at home. How do I do it? First of all giving you a detailed map with loads of tips about restaurants, museums, coffee places where only locals go. Secondly providing you with tickets for anything you would like to see in advance, to avoid you waste of time. Transport cards, bikes, reservations for restaurants... Anything you might need!\r\r\nI now manage other B&B's and self-catered apartments in the city. If this B&B is already booked I can always offer you some alternative. Friendly and professional: that's what best describes my work ethics. Looking forward to welcoming you here. Ciao",

Being a foreigner myself, I know what an outsider would love to see and experience. I love to introduce others to my favorite hangouts. From the best restaurants and museums to the most dingy bars and everything in between, I would love to help you experience Amsterdam the way I love to live it!",

I love to scuba dive and ski although I'm not very good at either of them. And I also love love love food! :) Travelling has taken a back seat in the last year though as I'm now spending most of my time with my baby boy. Having said that, this has allowed me to explore Amsterdam in a different light. :)\r\r\n\r\r\nIf you have any special requests for your stay or need information on places to go, eat, drink, be merry in Amsterdam or outside, please do not hesitate to drop me a line.

With its canals, bridges, and unique canal houses, I think it is one of the most beautiful cities in the world.\r\r\nI just published a book 'Sex and Drugs before Rock 'n' Roll'. Youth Culture and Masculinity during Holland's Golden Age', and I work now as a journalist and write about art, history, nightlife, and sports for many tourist magazines about Amsterdam including Time Out Amsterdam, You in Amsterdam, and The Holland Times. I am always happy to advise guests at my place about the events going on in the city.\r\r\n\r\r\nI will be happy to welcome you to my place and help you have a fantastic time in the city I call home.",
